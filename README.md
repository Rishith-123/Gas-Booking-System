# Gas-Booking-System
**Gas Booking System Readme**

This readme file provides an overview of the Gas Booking System implemented using HTML, CSS, PHP, and PostgreSQL. The system is designed to manage gas bookings and transactions between agencies, distributors, and users.

**Project Overview:**
The Gas Booking System is a web-based application that aims to streamline the process of gas booking and distribution. It facilitates interactions between gas agencies, distributors, and users, providing a seamless experience for managing gas supply and transactions. The project utilizes front-end technologies (HTML and CSS) and back-end technologies (PHP and PostgreSQL) to implement this functionality.

**Functionalities:**
The project offers the following functionalities:

**For Gas Agencies:**
1. **Manage Distributors:** Gas agencies can add, update, or remove distributors who handle gas deliveries to users.

2. **Track Orders:** Agencies can monitor the status of orders placed by users, including order processing and delivery.

3. **Inventory Management:** Agencies can manage their gas inventory, ensuring an adequate supply for distribution.

**For Distributors:**
1. **Accept Orders:** Distributors can view and accept gas booking orders placed by users for delivery.

2. **Assign Delivery:** Distributors can assign specific delivery personnel to fulfill gas delivery orders.

3. **Update Status:** Distributors can update the status of orders to indicate order processing and delivery stages.

**For Users:**
1. **Place Orders:** Users can place orders for gas booking, specifying the quantity required and delivery address.

2. **Order Tracking:** Users can track the status of their orders, including confirmation, processing, and delivery.

**Technology Stack:**
- **HTML:** Used to structure the web pages, including forms and layout.
- **CSS:** Utilized to style the web pages, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **PHP:** Employed for server-side scripting and handling various operations such as order processing, user management, and interactions with the database.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used as the relational database management system to store information related to gas orders, users, agencies, distributors, and more.

**Usage:**
1. Set up a web server (e.g., Apache) and configure it to run PHP scripts.

2. Import the provided SQL file into your PostgreSQL database to create the necessary tables for orders, users, agencies, distributors, and other relevant data.

3. Place the project files (HTML, CSS, PHP) within the document root directory of the web server.

4. Access the project through a web browser, where the system's interface will guide you through the functionalities based on the user type (agency, distributor, user).

**Note:** This readme provides an overview of the Gas Booking System. To understand the implementation details, interactions between different user roles, and the structure of the PostgreSQL database, refer to the source code and relevant documentation.
